# Guess The Number game

A simple Python-based game that asks the user to specify the number of guessing games they want to play, after which a random number between 0 and 25 (both inclusive) is selected and the user provides their guess as an input. If the guess is too low or too high, the script indicates so. When the players guesses the correct number, the game tells them how many guesses were required to find the number.
